# 🛡️ Mirror Shield – TECHIN510 Interactive Simulation Project

## Projective objective:
Develop an interactive simulation tool to help users recognize, understand, and respond to manipulative behaviors often associated with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), such as gaslighting, love bombing, and blame-shifting. The tool will educate users through realistic dialogue paths and reflection mechanisms, fostering emotional resilience and awareness.

## Target users:
- Individuals recovering from toxic relationships or emotionally manipulative dynamics
- People vulnerable to manipulation (empaths, highly sensitive individuals, caregivers)
- Supporters or friends of those affected

## Features:
- Branching scenario simulator with AI/NPD-patterned dialogue
- Real-time red flag radar that highlights manipulation tactics
- Toolkit with therapist-informed scripts for boundary setting
- Emotional energy meter to visualize the toll of interactions

## Planned feature:
- One fully functioning dialogue path with branching choices
- “Red Flag Radar” module with pattern-matching logic
- Visual energy meter synced with user responses
- Responsive front-end with basic styling

## Features nice-to-have:
- Reflection journaling component
- Weekly insights or progress summary
- Unlockable tips/educational content based on engagement
- Sound/visual cues for emotional tone

## Installation instruction:
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
